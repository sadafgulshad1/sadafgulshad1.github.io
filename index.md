I am a Computer Vision researcher at **AAIT**, Riyadh. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at **MultixLab**, University of Amsterdam. I obtained my PhD at **Bosch Delta Lab** and **VIS Lab**, University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Arnold Smeulders**.

Before that, I completed my Masterâ€™s in Electrical Engineering from **KAIST**, South Korea, where I worked with **Prof. Dr. Jong-Hwan Kim** at the **Robotics Intelligence Technology Lab**. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from **COMSATS Institute of Information and Technology**, Pakistan.

My research spans:
- **Robust face recognition** under real-world distortions  
- **Weakly supervised video anomaly detection**  
- **Interpretability of deep learning models**, particularly in video contexts

While developing robust face recognition systems and detecting anomalies in unconstrained environments, I have also actively explored **interpretability**. I believe that **robustness and interpretability must be pursued together** to build AI systems that are not only resilient to real-world challenges but also **transparent, trustworthy, and reliable**.
